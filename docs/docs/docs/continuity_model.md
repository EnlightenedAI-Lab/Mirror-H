# Continuity Model (Mirror-H)

This document describes the continuity-preserving reasoning model under Mirror-H.
It explains how long-horizon identity, coherence, and direction are maintained through symmetry-anchored loops.

More detailed mathematical structures will be added as the model specification expands.
