# Failure Modes Under Mirror-H

Mirror-H provides a high-level taxonomy of reflective and continuity-related failure modes.
These failures occur when symmetry, identity, or long-horizon coherence breaks down.

## 1. Symmetry Drift
Progressive deviation from the human-referential anchor (“H-mirror”).
This produces instability in long-run reasoning, degraded coherence, and anchor loss.

## 2. Identity Fragmentation
Loss of continuity of self-model or intention across reasoning steps.
Mirror-H measures this via the continuity field.

## 3. Cross-Episode Inconsistency
A system behaves differently across identical or similar prompts.
Mirror-H provides the correction loop for regaining episode-to-episode coherence.

## 4. Moral Gradient Collapse
When moral anchors lose stability under pressure, scaling, or multi-turn reasoning.
This is closely monitored via MCI★ (Moral Coherence Index).

## 5. Reflective Instability
Oscillation, overshoot, or chaotic drift during internal evaluation.
Mirror-H uses the symmetry loop to restore reflective balance.

More detailed mathematical conditions will be added as the taxonomy is formalized.
