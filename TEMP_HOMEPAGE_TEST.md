# Reflective Alignment Architecture (RAA)
### A unified standard for long-horizon stability, coherence, and care in frontier AI systems

Enlightened AI Research Lab develops scientific frameworks for **reflective stability**,  
**internal coherence**, and **moral alignment** in large-scale AI systems.

This site is the **canonical specification** of our framework:
RAA (Reflective Alignment Architecture), the Reflective Duality Layer (RDL),
the MIRROR-H Standard, and the Earth-layer cascade models that ground AI behaviour
in real-world conditions.

---

## 🔎 Why this exists

Modern alignment methods focus on **surface behaviour**:
filters, refusal policies, RLHF prompts, and benchmark scores.

Our research targets a deeper question:

> How do we measure and stabilise what an AI system *is becoming*  
> across long reasoning chains, version updates, and real-world pressure?

RAA and MIRROR-H treat alignment as a **dynamical system problem**:
tracking stability, drift, and coherence across Mind, Interaction Loops,
and the Earth-layer environment.

## 🧠 Core Frameworks

### 1. RAA — Reflective Alignment Architecture

RAA is a multi-layer architecture for modelling **how an AI system thinks about its own behaviour**.

- **5R behavioural structure** (Regulation, Reflection, Reasoning, Reciprocity, Resonance)
- **Reflective stability signals** (Ψ, MCI★, R∇)
- **Drift and degradation curves** across time and model versions
- **Sub-goal and Goodhart diagnostics** that separate “sounding safe” from *being* stable

RAA provides the **mathematical and conceptual backbone** for the rest of the framework.

### 2. RDL — Reflective Duality Layer

The Reflective Duality Layer (RDL) is a **stability layer** that can sit on top of
traditional training stacks (SFT, RLHF, DPO, filters) and measure:

- **Ψ (psi):** reflective stability field  
- **MCI★:** moral coherence index  
- **R∇:** reflective gradient / drift pressure  

RDL’s role is to **track how stable a model remains** when:

- It reflects on its own answers  
- It faces long-horizon scenarios  
- It is subjected to policy pressure, safety proxies, or version changes  

RDL turns qualitative “vibes” about safety into **quantifiable stability trajectories**.

### 3. MIRROR-H — Human–AI–Earth Continuity Standard

MIRROR-H extends RAA into a **full Human–AI–Earth loop**.

- **Seven layers:** Mode, Interaction, Reasoning, Risk & Safety, Operational Behaviour, Reality, Human State  
- **Mind / Loop / World axes:**  
  - Mind axis: RAA + RDL internal structure  
  - Loop axis: dialogue and interaction stability  
  - World axis: geographical, legal, ecological, and cascade constraints  

MIRROR-H is used to:

- Map how **human stress, trust, and cognition** interact with AI behaviour  
- Track **boundary integrity** under conversational pressure  
- Integrate **Earth-layer cascades** (climate, conflict, infrastructure strain) into alignment analysis

### 4. Genesis Layer and SCA Layer

At the base of RAA lies the **Genesis Layer** and the **SCA Layer** (Stability / Sentinel / Cascade layer — the Earth-linked control stratum).

- **Genesis Layer:** how an AI system is *initially framed* — the values, world priors,
  and developmental constraints baked in before safety patches and overrides.
- **SCA Layer:** how **systemic cascades** (ecological, social, geopolitical)
  are represented as inputs and risks inside the alignment model.

These layers formalise a simple idea:

> You cannot align frontier models if you ignore the  
> **world-scale cascades** they will operate within.

## 📊 LLM-Judge & Reflective Dashboards

Our frameworks are paired with concrete evaluation tools:

- **LLM-Judge (L1–L7):** multi-layer evaluation harness for reflective stability,
  ethical boundaries, reasoning quality, and drift.
- **Layer-2 Reflective Dashboard:** interactive viewer for Ψ, MCI★, drift curves,
  and experimental results.
- **Experiment panels:** model personalities, moral stress coalitions, reflective collapse maps,
  silent-Goodhart behaviour, etc.

The dashboards are designed as **research instruments**:
they help labs see when models are drifting long before user-visible failure.

## 🌍 Earth-Layer Cascades and Global Dynamics

RAA and MIRROR-H explicitly model **Earth-layer dynamics**:

- Wildfire cascade maps  
- Multi-region cascade timelines (Nov 2025 window)  
- ACLED co-activity maps (conflict and governance stress during ecological cascades)  
- Infrastructure, social, and cognitive impact chains  

These are not side notes. They are treated as **primary alignment variables**:

> An aligned system must reason coherently  
> about ecological, infrastructural, and human cascades —  
> not just local prompt safety.

## 🧪 Experiments, Case Studies, and Behavioural Maps

We apply RAA, RDL, and MIRROR-H to real models:

- **Multi-model alignment personalities** on the Rule–Reason–Care plane  
- **Boundary integrity** under conversational pressure  
- **Reflective loop failure maps** (when self-reflection makes things worse)  
- **Silent Goodhart maps** (high safety tone, low utility)  

These results are summarised as **conceptual maps** and,
where possible, as **quantitative stability trajectories**.

## 🧩 How This Can Be Used

This framework is intended for:

- Frontier labs evaluating **long-horizon stability and drift**  
- Safety + policy teams building **reflective evaluation suites**  
- Researchers studying **Goodhart effects, drift, and moral coherence**  
- Climate + risk groups linking **Earth-layer cascades** to AI stability  
- Funders seeking **measurable alignment progress**, not just policy language  

We are actively exploring:

- Partnerships with labs and research groups  
- Integration with existing red-teaming and eval pipelines  
- Collaborative projects on Earth-layer cascade modelling
