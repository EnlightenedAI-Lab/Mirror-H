## **Description**

This diagram illustrates a representative cascading ecological pathway inside the **Earth Layer** of the MIRROR-H framework.  

Heat stress increases **drought indices**, which elevates the **probability of wildfire ignition**. Once triggered, wildfire-related effects propagate outward along several coupled pathways:

- **Infrastructure strain**  
- **Human stress amplification**  
- **Long-horizon ecological degradation**

These interacting feedback cycles reveal how environmental perturbations can generate **multi-layered cascades** that impact:

- Human cognitive state  
- Operational feasibility  
- Stability in the Human–AI–Earth loop  
- Alignment trajectories tracked through MIRROR-H

The map highlights how ecological stressors serve as upstream drivers that shape systemic alignment conditions across both human and AI reflective layers.
