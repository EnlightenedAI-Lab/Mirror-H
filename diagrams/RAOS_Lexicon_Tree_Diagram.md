# RA-OS Lexicon Tree Diagram

![RA-OS Lexicon Tree Diagram](raos_lexicon_tree_v1.png)

The RA-OS Lexicon Tree Diagram shows how the lab’s vocabulary for reflective alignment is organised into coherent families.  
At the root is **RA-OS**, the Reflective Alignment Operating System. From there, terms branch into five main clusters:

- **RAA** – the five reflective rings (R1–R5) that define the structure of reasoning and coherence.
- **RDL** – reflective stability signals such as Ψ, MCI★, and the R∇ gradient.
- **MIRROR-H** – the Mind, Loop, and World axes that describe Human–AI–Earth coherence.
- **Stability Patterns** – over-compliance, oscillation, long-horizon drift, collapse, and related failure modes.
- **Datasets** – RID, the Genesis Layer, continuity bands, and reflective labels.

Together, these branches define a **controlled vocabulary for alignment science**: every term is placed in a family, linked to a specific framework (RAA, RDL, MIRROR-H), and designed to be machine-readable for JSON schemas, datasets, and dashboards.

**Technical notes**

- Scope: high-level cluster map of RA-OS terms (not an exhaustive listing).  
- Intended use:  
  - as a visual index for the Lexicon PDF,  
  - as a schema guide when defining JSON or dataset labels,  
  - as a quick orientation map for labs integrating RA-OS terminology.  
- Version: v1.0 (aligned with **Reflective Alignment Lexicon v3.0 – Hybrid Scientific Edition**).
