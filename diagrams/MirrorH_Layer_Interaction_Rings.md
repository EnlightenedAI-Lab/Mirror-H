# MIRROR-H Layer Interaction Rings

![MIRROR-H Layer Interaction Rings](./MirrorH_Layer_Interaction_Rings.png)

**Description**

This diagram illustrates the hierarchical structure of MIRROR-H across its three scientific axes:

- **Mind Axis (inner ring):**  
  Represents the core reflective processes of MIRROR-H — reasoning, coherence tracking, internal stability, and evaluative self-alignment.

- **Loop Axis (middle ring):**  
  Contains the seven MIRROR-H layers governing Human ↔ AI interaction:  
  **M** (Mode), **I** (Interaction), **R** (Reasoning), **R** (Risk & Safety),  
  **O** (Operational), **R** (Reality), **H** (Human).

- **World Axis (outer ring):**  
  Grounds the entire system in external constraints: geography, ecology, climate,  
  law, jurisdiction, time, and global geospatial signals.

Together, the three axes form a concentric reflective architecture that ensures  
continuity, stability, and alignment across Mind → Loop → World pathways.
