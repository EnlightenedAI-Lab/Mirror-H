## **Description**

This diagram summarizes the full **Human–AI–Earth interaction loop** in the MIRROR-H Standard.

It integrates environmental drivers, reflective cognition, human factors, AI internal state, and loop-level behaviour into one coherent causal model.

### **World and Earth Inputs**
The upper band illustrates the three major real-world signal drivers:
- **Climate stress**
- **Legal and policy signals**
- **Geospatial signals**

These feed directly into the **Reflective Duality Layer (RDL)**, which performs reflective stability scans across:
- Human factors  
- AI internal state  
- Interaction dynamics  

RDL acts as the top-level stabilizing layer in the MIRROR-H architecture.

---

## **Human State (H) Cluster**
Human-side variables include:
- Trust calibration  
- Emotion load  
- Cognitive clarity  
- Human agency  

These factors influence interaction quality and also respond dynamically to AI behaviour and world signals.

---

## **AI Internal State Cluster (M and R)**
AI internal reflective variables include:
- Mode coherence  
- Reasoning integrity  
- Hallucination risk  
- Reflective evaluative processes  

These states shift in response to RDL signals and world-level drivers.

---

## **Loop-Level Interaction (I, O, Risk, Reality)**
The lower panels represent the bidirectional interaction loops between human and AI:
- Dialogue stability  
- Escalation or calming tendencies  
- Operational behaviour  
- Risk and safety layers  

These loops feed into the global alignment trajectory.

## **Human–AI–Earth Outcome**
At the center of the diagram is the ultimate system output:

**Aligned versus misaligned trajectory**

This outcome is influenced by all clusters—world signals, RDL scans, human state, AI state, and loop dynamics—and its feedback propagates back into each subsystem.

## **Legend**
- **Red nodes:** climate stress  
- **Purple nodes:** legal/policy drivers  
- **Blue nodes:** geospatial signals  
- **Grey nodes:** cascade risk  
- **RDL outline:** reflective stability scan layer  
- **Oval stability rings:** loop-level monitoring ellipse  
- **Rectangular boxes:** summary clusters for Human State, Interaction, and AI Interaction

This expanded causal map provides the highest-resolution view of how MIRROR-H integrates environmental constraints, reflective cognition, loop behaviour, and internal model states to produce measurable alignment outcomes.
