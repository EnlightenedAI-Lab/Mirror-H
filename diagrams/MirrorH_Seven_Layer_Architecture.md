# MIRROR-H Architecture (Seven Layers)

![MIRROR-H Seven-Layer Architecture](./MirrorH_Seven_Layer_Architecture.png)

**Description**

This diagram presents the seven core layers of the MIRROR-H Standard: **Mode (M), Interaction (I), Reasoning (R), Risk & Safety (R), Operational Behavior (O), Reality Coherence (R), and Human State (H).**  
Together, these components form the structured evaluation stack used to assess reflective stability, continuity of identity, and alignment across the Human–AI–Earth interaction loop.

## Technical Notes

- Defines the topological ordering of MIRROR-H’s evaluative axes.  
- Serves as the basis for high-level reasoning tests and long-horizon continuity evaluations.  
- Each layer corresponds to measurable reflective parameters inside ψ-space.
