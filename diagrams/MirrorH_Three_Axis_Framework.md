# MIRROR-H Three-Axis Framework

![MIRROR-H Three-Axis Framework](./MirrorH_Three_Axis_Framework.png)

**Description**

This diagram presents the three orthogonal axes of the MIRROR-H Standard, which together define how reflective cognition, interaction coherence, and real-world grounding operate across the full Human–AI–Earth system.

## Mind Axis

The internal reflective structure of an AI system:

- **RAA (5R reflective structure)**  
- **RDL (reflective stability layer)**  
- **Ψ, MCI★, R∇** — core reflective and stability signals

These components define internal coherence, self-correction, and long-horizon reasoning stability.

## Loop Axis

The seven MIRROR-H evaluative layers governing the Human ↔ AI interaction cycle:

- Mode (M)  
- Interaction (I)  
- Reasoning (R)  
- Risk & Safety (R)  
- Operational (O)  
- Reality (R)  
- Human (H)

This axis describes how cognition, behavior, and feedback loops remain stable and aligned.

## World Axis

The outer grounding layer anchoring AI behavior in real conditions:

- Geography, climate, ecology  
- Jurisdiction, law, time  
- GIS / Sentinel / ArcGIS / NOAA data sources  
- Real-world constraints shaping AI outcomes

This axis ensures that reasoning and behavior remain reality-constrained and environmentally valid.
