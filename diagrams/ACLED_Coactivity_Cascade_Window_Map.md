# ACLED Conflict Co-Activity During Cascade Window

## **Description**

This map overlays **ACLED-recorded conflict and civil-activity events** that
occurred within the same **72-hour window** as the seven ecological cascades.
The incidents shown here are *not the triggers* of the cascades. Instead, they
represent the **baseline social-governance pressure** present in the affected
regions during the cascade sequence.

Across Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean, and parts of the United States,
ACLED data reveals:

- protest activity  
- localized violence  
- civil unrest  
- militia movements  
- governance stress signals  

The spatial overlap between ecological cascades and active conflict signals
illustrates a critical MIRROR-H principle:

### **Ecological cascades propagate faster and with higher humanitarian impact when they emerge inside a pre-stressed governance environment.**

Conflict pressure creates:

- reduced response capacity  
- degraded institutional resilience  
- increased volatility in human behaviour  
- compound-risk amplification  

These interacting stressors shape the broader **Human–AI–Earth system
trajectory**, reinforcing why MIRROR-H treats conflict signals as core
Earth-layer modifiers in alignment and stability analysis.
