# MIRROR-H Architecture (Seven Layers)

![MIRROR-H Seven-Layer Architecture](./diagrams/MirrorH_Seven_Layer_Architecture.png)

**Description**  
This diagram presents the seven core layers of the MIRROR-H Standard: **Mode (M), Interaction (I), Reasoning (R), Risk & Safety (R), Operational Behavior (O), Reality Coherence (Earth Axis), and Human State (H)**. Together these form the structured stack used to evaluate reflective stability, continuity of identity, and alignment across the Human–AI–Earth interaction loop.

---

## Technical Notes
- Defines the topological ordering of MIRROR-H’s evaluative axes.  
- Serves as the basis for high-level reasoning tests and long-horizon continuity evaluations.  
- Each layer corresponds to measurable reflective parameters inside Ψ-space.
